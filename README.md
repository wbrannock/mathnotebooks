### Math Notebooks
When learning math I find it best to work through problems interactively. These notebooks contain my work on various math topics I find interesting.

## Clone and Run via UV
You can clone this repository and run the notebooks using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wbrannock/mathnotebooks.git
cd mathnotebooks
uv sync
```
